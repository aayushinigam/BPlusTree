### ASSIGNMENT 3 - B+ TREE IMPLEMENTATION

1. Code is implemented in **python3**  and uses the library **bisect** for insertion in sorted order.

##### How to run? 
1. Run the python file as `python3 2020201045.py <input-file-path>`
2. The output will be saved in a file named **output.txt**

##### Input format - 
It is assumed that the input will be integers only, with the following constraint : **-10^9 <= INPUT <= 10^9**
Query format -
1. **INSERT X** - inserting a key X into the tree.
2. **FIND X** - finding a key in the tree (returns YES if found,else NO).
3. **COUNT X** - counts number of occurrences of a key X in the tree.
4. **RANGE X Y**  - counts number of keys in the range [X,Y].
